Changelog
=========

Version 1.2 Beta 1
------------------

Implemented ability to force a field value in a nested resource to be set to
the URL of an ascending resource. This is done using the optional attribute
``field_forced_to_ancestor`` on the serializer's ``Meta`` class.


Version 1.1

Re-worked the mechanism for URL generation to support cross-linking resource
trees.

**Breaking change**: Any previous usage of many-to-many fields on variables
in the current request's URL will now break.

Added proper support for namespaced URLs
